Act-On Interview Coding Test

This test is not intended just as a test of coding ability, but also of how you think and organize things. We want to get a sense of what we would see if you were actually 
committing code in our environment.  To that end, please treat this as a production problem.  Abstractions, tests, design choices, efficiency, and general professionalism will 
all be considered when evaluating the test. We are not specifying a time limit to allow for more attention to detail in meeting the requirements. Please include all all necessary
 source and project files (including dependencies, if applicable) to build, test, and execute the solution.

Using the translation service described below, create a command line tool in Java to translate an arbitrary number of files from English to Swedish. (3 examples provided). 
The tool should take the names of the files as arguments. Although the example files are small, the solution should be able to handle arbitrarily large files; that is, assume 
each input file and output file may be larger in bytes than the memory allocated to the JVM.  All specified input files should be read and translated concurrently; that is, 
lines from each file should be processed in parallel without being blocked by the progress of the other files or by the batches.  The results should be written to two separate
 text files output to the current directory. The first should be named AsYouGo.txt and have all results, one word per line, written as soon as they are processed. The second 
 should be named Batched.txt and have one word per line in batches. Each batch should contain one translated result from each file, and sorted within the batch in alphabetical
  order. The batches should correspond to the original ordering in the files (i.e. the first batch would be a sorted list of the translations from the 1st line of each file, 
  the second a sorted list from the 2nd line of each file, and so on).  Example:

Given the following files:

File1:
one
two
three

File2: 
four
five
six

File3:
seven
eight
nine

If the translations are:

File1:
en
två
tre

File2:
fyra
fem
sex

File3:
sju
åtta
nio

Then the batched result would be:

en
fyra
sju
fem
två
åtta
nio
sex
tre

Translate Service URL: 
	
	https://translate.googleapis.com/translate_a/single?client=gtx&sl=en&tl=sv&dt=t&q={toTranslate}

Notes on the API: 
- The deficiencies of this endpoint are part of the excercise. 
- The URL already includes the parameters for English to Swedish
- It will temporarily block usage if it is used too much so test carefully. 
- It is legitimate for the translation to return the original word in cases where it's not found. In those cases the original should be used in the output.
